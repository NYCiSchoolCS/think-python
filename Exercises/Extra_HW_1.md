# Validate a credit card number

1. Write a function validate_cc() that takes a credit card number as input and prints "Not a valid credit card" or prints "This card is a X" where X is Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover.

  A credit card is valid if the first digit is correct and if the number of digits is correct.
