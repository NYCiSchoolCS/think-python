# Validate a credit card number

1. Write a function validate_cc() that takes a credit card number as input and prints "Not a valid credit card" or prints "This card is a X" where X is Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover.

  A credit card is valid if the first digit is correct and if the number of digits is correct. You can use these test numbers for testing your function: http://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/vhelp/paypalmanager_help/credit_card_numbers.htm

  Hint: use len() to check the length of a string. Use x[0] to get the first character of string x.
