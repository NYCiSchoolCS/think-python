# Unit 2 - In class exercises

## Exercise 3.3. in Think Python

Python provides a built-in function called `len()` that returns the length of a string, so
the value of `len('allen')` is 5.
Write a function named right_justify that takes a string named `s` as a parameter and prints the
string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70 of the display.

Sample output:
```
                                                                 allen
```
