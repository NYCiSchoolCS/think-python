# Loops!

### Sum all the numbers

Write a program that adds the numbers from 0 to 10

Output:
```
45
```

Now change your program to ask you for a number first, and sum the numbers from 0 to that number.
Sample Output:
```
Enter a number: 40
780
```

Next, ask the user for every number to add.
Sample Output:
```
Enter a number: 3
Enter a number to sum: 6
Enter a number to sum: 4
Enter a number to sum: 8
18
```

### Count down with `for`!

Write a program that asks the user for a number, and then uses a `for` loop to print a count down from that number. Don't forget to launch the rocket at the end!

Sample Output:
```
Enter a number: 5
5
4
3
2
1
Blast off!
```
