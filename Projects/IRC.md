#iSchool IRC

IRC, short for Internet Relay Chat, is a chat messaging system that allows users to send text messages to each other in discussion forums (called "channels"). IRC was created by Jarkko Oikarinen in August 1988 in Fineland, but it didn't become popular until the early 1990s. The top 100 IRC networks now served more than half a million users at a time.
