# Yahtzee

## The Rules
The object of the game is to score the most points by rolling five dice to make certain combinations. The dice can be rolled up to three times in a turn to try to make one of the thirteen possible scoring combinations. A game consists of thirteen rounds during which the player chooses which scoring combination is to be used in that round. Once a combination has been used in the game, it cannot be used again.

The scoring combinations have varying point values, some of which are fixed values and others of which have the cumulative value of the dice. A Yahtzee is five-of-a-kind and holds the game's highest point value of 50.

## Instructions
We wrote some starter code for implementing scoring in Yahtzee. The code is in Yahtzee.py. The code will simulate a rolling the dice and scoring the roll. We wrote the definitions of the scoring functions, but we haven't filled them in yet. That is your job.

### Steps
* Write code to implement the chance_score function.


* Write code to implement the five_of_a_kind function.


* Write code to to implement the remaining scofing functions. Think about how you could combine ones_score, twos_score, threes_score etc. into one function?
